#dar.ui

Frontend web framework that aims to make development
of rich highly interactive user interfaces as easy as
rendering of plain HTML documents. It achieves that
by empowering [FRP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming)
paradigm to provide all sorts of tools proved to be useful and necessary
for one-shot data transformations and employing simple and efficient virtual DOM
abstraction.
